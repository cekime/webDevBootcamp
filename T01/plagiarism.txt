   b) Direct Plagiarism: copying work from another source such as directly from an online article.  
   c) Mosaic Plagiarism: copying and blending together information from a range of sources without referencing, such as taking information from various news articles.   
   d) Accidental Plagiarism: copying from another source unitentionally, e.g. listening to a lecture on a topic & then later using the ideas without realising where they originated from.
